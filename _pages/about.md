I am currently a PhD student at Vrije Universiteit Brussels. My Ph.D. advisor is [Prof. dr. Tias Guns](http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~tiasguns/). My research falls at the confluence of machine learning (ML) and combinatorial optimization problem (COP). 

In my PhD, I study *<font color="#FF6600">Decision-focused learning</font>*. In decision-focused learning, ML prediction is followed by COP for decision making. 
The goal is to train the ML model, very often a neural network model, directly considering the error after the COP. The challenge is how to embed the COP into the ML training loop.  
I work on differentiable optimizer, which enables passing the gradient through the COP for training the ML model. 
I am also interested in scalable decision-focused learning, so that it can be applied in real-life COP, which are often NP-hard and difficult to solve.
